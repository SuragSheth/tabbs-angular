Dear Pagerduty:

I was recently informed about your open position for a Jr. Web Developer, and I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity. I’m a Full Stack and Mobile Software Developer from the Bay Area, graduating with a Bachelor’s of Technological Entrepreneurship in August 2015 and I am confident I would excel in this role.

My education and personal projects have allowed me to work with many of the technologies used for Pagerduty. I have built web applications with NodeJs and NoSql databases, implemented RESTful routing and MVC framework ideologies, and have also created multiple API’s for iOS and web applications. I thoroughly enjoy solving the problems that arise in multithreaded environments.

I am no stranger to working in a team environment, as I have done with full stack projects in the past. My peers have described me as a positive team player and a reliable resource for software design. I thrive in work settings where I can discuss and weigh solutions with other developers. 

Thank you for considering me for this position. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions. I would be happy to further discuss how my work ethic and experience can benefit Pagerduty. 

Best,
Surag Sheth
